# Timer App

The goal is to create a simple application that lets me keep track of what I spend my time on and then visualize that data in different ways such as a bar graph, pie chart, etc. .

## Features

* User can create custom categories for each time entry.
* Data can be visualized via a pie chart for a given day.

* User can start/pause and stop timer.

## Future Features

* Visualize data for different time fram such as a week or month.
* Allow user to manually enter time entries. Exa. Time: 1H:30M:00S Category: Studying Date: MM/DD/YYYY
* Filter certain categories for data visualization
